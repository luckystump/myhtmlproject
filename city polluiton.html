<h3>According to San Francisco Department of the Environment,  San Francisco&rsquo;s citywide carbon footprint totaled 5.4 million metric tons of carbon dioxide annually in 2010. Our cars, companies and even our everyday living has contributed to the amount of carbon emission. The useage of turning on our lights, running our computers and factories and every day transportations serves a large impact to the environment today. Pumping large capacity of natural gas from areas and replacing the land with other liquid to cover the areas pumped can affect land areas and pollute water lines. This cause earthquake to appear more often as the drilling affects the plate tectonics and studies show that areas that has been drilled are prone to have more earthquakes. </h3>
