<h3>Co2 emisson is a large impact to today's society. Our burning of fossil fuel to run our every day lives with eletricity and gasoline has contributed in polluted our ecosystem, wild life, air quality and global warming. This is a large impact because fossil fuels are extemely easy for corporations to occupy. The fuel comes in different forms and transportations to obtain. Today, we mine for coal and burn them to produce energy. We also use pumps to take petroleum from the earth. Natural gas is taking in a more timely matter as they are replaced with other fluids after being taken out of the earth. Some other alternatives are nuclear power plants. However these requre mining for uranium and uses water to cool down the plant. The extreme hot water is the released into the atmosphere and kills many wild life that are not suitable to survive in their habitat. </h3>
