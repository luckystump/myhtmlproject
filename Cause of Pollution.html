<h3>Fossil fuels are the major energy sources but still when over consumption takes place lead to disastrous effects such as air pollution. Burning of fossil fuels releases carbon dioxide, nitrogen monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulphur dioxide, carbon monoxide etc. that have severe consequences on the habitats. Burning these fossil fuels are also unrenewable so after using the fuel provided, there will no longer be any left. Fossil fuels are found in high capacity and also cheap to utilize and get ahold of. The government endorse companies to pump more fossil fuels from the land and also ship crude oils from other countries to use. The government also subsidize companies to lower their prices on gasoline for vehicle and home usage. The natural gas and fossil used today are not renewable and will soon run out.</h3>
